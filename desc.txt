Backend: Designing an Automated Email Scheduling API

Objective: 
The objective of this assignment is to design and implement an API that allows users to schedule emails for automatic delivery at specified times.
This involves creating endpoints to accept payloads containing email details (recipient, subject, body) along with a schedule time, and implementing a backend process to handle the scheduling and sending of emails accordingly. 
The API will also include options for scheduling recurring emails on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, thereby automating the process of email delivery and ensuring that emails are sent as per user-defined schedules.

Features to Include
